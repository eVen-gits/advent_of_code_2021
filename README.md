~~I will try to make one line solutions using standard python library.~~

Update: It doesn't look like I will ðŸ˜¬ Can't afford that much time, unfortunately.

However, I will still try to provide some decent answers, using readable (hopefully) code and some mechanics that are available in python for practice :)
